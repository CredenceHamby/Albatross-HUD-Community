## Albatross HUD Change History

### 2.1.2
* Added a param option for atmo speed limiter (default on). If on, this will limit your speed in atmosphere to 8% less than the ship's burn speed. In space, it will attempt to slow you down to under the burn speed before hitting the atmosphere (this will not work on moons).
* Added a param option to add a new flight mode toggle for ground-hover mode (default off). This mode essentially disables your airfoils and maxes hover height with auto-level.
* Added a hotkey (A+S:9) to toggle the Build Helper display (default off).

### 2.1.1
* Fixed AGG reading previous target instead of resetting target to current Base.
* Removed the voice command option from showing up erroneously.

### 2.1.0
* Added new HUD widget to support Antigravity display and control.
* Added param option to switch Brakes mode to a pure toggle control.
* Corrected max cruise speed in space.
* Increased default HUD scale.
* Added param option for ship to begin in Cruise mode instead of Throttle.
* Added param option for remote control units to freeze player movement or not.
